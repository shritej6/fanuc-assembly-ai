## 2026-10-29 · T05 review fixes · CODEX

- Added a fail-closed joint guard for the official J1-J6 limits and gripper range; TCP actions now additionally require
  the measured fingers-down set-O envelope (`w` within 3 degrees of +/-180, `p` within 3 degrees, free bounded yaw).
- `CellAdapter` resolves `DT` on every action call, so the guard validates the same live value the client transmits.
  `Policy` supplies that live value without changing the default joint-hold runtime.
- Regression coverage includes malformed, NaN/Inf, epsilon-outside and NumPy float32/float64 chunks plus end-to-end
  policy rejection. `robot/cell/cell_client.py` remains unchanged.
- Verified: `uv run ruff check .` clean; `uv run pytest -q` 102 passed; official `uv run run.py --mock` completed
  3 rollouts / 600 actions / 0 rejected and printed `Ready for the real robot`.
- Next: Claude reviews PR #4; merge this commit into T09 before enabling the explicit cell runtime.

## 2026-10-27 · T05 · CODEX · adapter layer and UF0 safety guard

- Changed: `robot/adapter.py`, `robot/__init__.py`, `robot/cell/policy.py`, `tests/test_robot_adapter.py`, and
  `pyproject.toml`. Sim, mock, and cell now share passive `reset()` / `act(observation)` adapters around an injected
  controller; the vendored policy imports the repo adapter without `PYTHONPATH` and defaults to observed joint hold.
- Run: `uv run pytest tests/test_robot_adapter.py -q` (61 passed); `uv run pytest` (73 passed);
  `uv run ruff check .` (passed); `git diff --check` (passed);
  `git diff --exit-code origin/main -- robot/cell/cell_client.py` (passed). Development smoke:
  `cd robot/cell && uv run run.py --mock --trials 1 --trial-s 0.5` → 1 rollout, 6 actions, 0 rejected. Final documented
  workflow: `cd robot/cell && uv sync && uv run run.py --mock` → exit 0, 3 rollouts, 601 actions, 0 rejected,
  `✓ Ready for the real robot`.
- Safety: TCP outputs are absolute UTOOL1 fingertip targets in UF0. The guard accepts one row or 1–100-row chunks,
  preserves nesting without mutating input, and requires finite numeric values, dt 0.1–1.0 s, x 150–650 mm,
  y −450–450 mm, z −334–300 mm, W/P/R within ±360°, and gripper 0–1, all inclusive. Violations raise contextual
  typed errors; values are never clamped. Sim observations are projected to official top-level fields, with copied
  nested mappings limited to public trial keys (`trial_id`, `index`, `layout`, `status`, `instruction`, `scored`),
  RGB cameras (`table`, `side`, `wrist`), and supported depth cameras (`table`, `wrist`); simulator ground truth,
  segmentation, and private depth metadata cannot reach controller callbacks. Joint mode holds the exact observed
  position, including when `tcp_pose` is `None`; no TCP home target is invented.
- Next: independent review, then open the T05 PR for Claude review and user merge. T09 can consume these adapters
  after T04 and T05 merge; no contract or `robot/cell/cell_client.py` changes are required.

## 2026-10-27 · T01 · CLAUDE · repo scaffold

- Changed: repo layout, `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` rules, `coord/` (TASKS, DECISIONS, HANDOFF), `contracts/` v1 (9 schemas
  + `taxonomy.json` with measured look-alike groups), root `pyproject.toml`, `tests/test_contracts.py`, vendored official
  client in `robot/cell/` (upstream commit in `UPSTREAM_COMMIT`, unmodified).
- Run: `uv sync && uv run pytest` (12 pass); `cd robot/cell && uv sync && uv run run.py --mock` → "✓ Ready for the real robot"
  with the placeholder policy.
- Facts: F01=F02 and F04=F05=F06 are identical shapes (0.0 mm); look-alike groups (≤ 2.5 mm) are listed in
  `contracts/taxonomy.json`. All contract poses are UF0 mm/deg.
- Next: T02 assembly sheets, T03 CAD risk ranking (CLAUDE); T04 catalog and T05 adapters are ready for Codex once the user
  marks them READY.
